	abstract = {Layer stacking and chemical stability are crucial for two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs), but are yet challenging to gain control. In this work, we demonstrate synthetic control of both the layer stacking and chemical stability of 2D COFs by managing interlayer steric hindrance via a multivariate (MTV) approach. By co-condensation of triamines with and without alkyl substituents (ethyl and isopropyl) and a di- or trialdehyde, a family of two-, three-, and four-component 2D COFs with AA, AB, or ABC stacking is prepared. The alkyl groups are periodically appended on the channel walls and their contents, which can be synthetically tuned by the MTV strategy, control the stacking model and chemical stability of 2D COFs by maximizing the total crystal stacking energy and protecting hydrolytically susceptible backbones through kinetic blocking. Speciﬁcally, the COFs with higher concentration of alkyl substituents adopt AB or ABC stacking, while lower amount of functionalities leads to the AA stacking. The COFs bearing high concentration of isopropyl groups represent the ﬁrst identiﬁed COFs that can retain crystallinity and porosity in boiling 20 M NaOH solution. After postsynthetic metalation with an iridium complex, the 2,2′-bipyridyl-derived COFs can heterogeneously catalyze C−H borylation of arenes, whereas the COF with isopropyl groups exhibits much higher activity than the COFs with ethyl groups and nonsubstituents due to the increased porosity and chemical stability. This work underscores the opportunity in using steric hindrance to tune and control layer stacking, chemical stability and properties of 2D COFs.},

The range of properties characterized in COFs has rapidly expanded to include those of interest for heterogeneous catalysis, energy storage and photovoltaic devices, and proton-conducting membranes. Yet many of these applications will require materials quality, morphological control, and synthetic efficiency exceeding the capabilities of contemporary synthetic methods. This level of control will emerge from an improved fundamental understanding of COF nucleation and growth processes. More powerful characterization of structure and defects, improved syntheses guided by mechanistic understanding, and accessing diverse isolated forms, ranging from single crystals to thin films to colloidal suspensions, remain important frontier problems.},

Notwithstanding this prevalence and impact, it is often still performed using the renaissance model of individual artisans gathered in a workshop, under the guidance of an established practitioner. Great beneﬁts could follow instead from adopting concepts and tools coming from computer science to manage, preserve, and share these computational efforts. We illustrate here our paradigm sustaining such vision, based around the four pillars of Automation, Data, Environment, and Sharing. We then discuss its implementation in the open-source AiiDA platform (http://www.aiida.net), that has been tuned ﬁrst to the demands of computational materials science. AiiDA’s design is based on directed acyclic graphs to track the provenance of data and calculations, and ensure preservation and searchability. Remote computational resources are managed transparently, and automation is coupled with data storage to ensure reproducibility. Last, complex sequences of calculations can be encoded into scientiﬁc workﬂows. We believe that AiiDA’s design and its sharing capabilities will encourage the creation of social ecosystems to disseminate codes, data, and scientiﬁc workﬂows.},

	abstract = {CH4 storage associated with adsorbed natural gas technology attracts considerable researches on ﬁnding porous materials with remarkable CH4 delivery performance. In this work, we update the online accessible computation-ready, experimental (CoRE) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) database with 280 COFs in 12 topologies. All framework structures are constructed and compiled from the respective experimental studies and are further evaluated for CH4 delivery. The highest deliverable capacity (DC) between 65 and 5.8 bar among the CoRE COFs is 190 v(STP)/v at 298 K achieved by 3D PI-COF-4. Structure−property relationships show that large volumetric surface area generally beneﬁts CH4 delivery. 2D-COFs can also be top performing materials if constructing their pore channels is passable in three dimensions, as the volumetric surface area will be increased accordingly. This idea can be realized by enlarging the interlayer spacings of 2D-COFs. We also evaluate the DC of CoRE COFs under conditions of 233 K, 65 bar (storage) and 358 K, 5.8 bar (discharge). The highest DC obtained from the CoRE COFs and the designed 2D-COFs are 314 and 337 v(STP)/v, respectively.},

The conditions of industrial vacuum (VSA) and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) processes were considered in the computation. Qualitative rules of COFs for noble gas separations were clariﬁed, and structural features of COFs with excellent separation performance were summarized and suggested. In addition, COFs with good separation performance were identiﬁed from our database for industrial cyclic process. The knowledge obtained in this work may give guidance for experimental efforts in seeking advanced materials for noble gas separation, and the CoRE COF database will facilitate the fundamental research of COFs as well as the development of novel functional materials toward practical applications.},

abstract = {Low electrical conductivity caused by low degree of $\pi$-conjugation and structural disorders induces critical limitations in electronic applications of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Here we focus on improving the electrical properties of COFs by synthesis of highly conjugated and crystalline COF (hcc-COF). Addition of a small amount of water and acetic acid induces the efficient reversible dynamic imine condensation reaction that is required to obtain uniform and crystalline products. Also, simulated sunlight irradiation facilitates the reversible imine condensation reaction, and achieves formation of hcc-COF with high-yield within short reaction time. The obtained hcc-COF has an extended $\pi$-conjugated structure along the lateral direction and an inclined stacking structure. The intrinsic electron transport properties along the in-plane direction are evaluated using a hcc-COF film grown on a water surface from a polarity-controlled precursor solution. To the best of our knowledge, our hcc-COF film shows the highest reported electrical conductivity for highly conjugated organic porous polymers.},

The prepared porous carbon possessed a speciﬁc capacitance of 230 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and could retain ∼98\% of the initial capacitance after 1500 successive charge−discharge cycles. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated that the material has a small equivalent series resistance (0.62 Ω). All of these values demonstrated that the prepared porous carbon is a promising supercapacitor material.

However, many existing deﬁnitions of NACs have limitations that prevent them from adequately fulﬁlling this dual purpose. Some charge methods are not applicable to periodic materials or are inaccurate for systems containing buried atoms, while others work for both periodic and nonperiodic materials containing buried atoms but give NACS that do not accurately reproduce V. We present a new approach, density derived electrostatic and chemical (DDEC) charges, that overcomes these limitations by simultaneously optimizing the NACs to be chemically meaningful and to reproduce V outside the electron distribution. This atoms-inmolecule method partitions the total electron density among atoms and uses a distributed multipole expansion to formally reproduce V exactly outside the electron distribution. We compare different methods for computing NACs for a broad range of materials that are periodic in zero, one, two, and three dimensions. The DDEC method consistently performs well for systems with and without buried atoms, including molecules, nonporous solids, solid surfaces, and porous solids like metal organic frameworks.},

The functional form of the method is related to the self-consistent density functional TB scheme and mostly avoids element-pair-specific parameters. The parametrization covers all spd-block elements and the lanthanides up to Z = 86 using reference data at the hybrid density functional theory level. Key features of the Hamiltonian are the use of partially polarized Gaussian-type orbitals, a double-ζ orbital basis for hydrogen, atomic-shell charges, diagonal third-order charge fluctuations, coordination number-dependent energy levels, a noncovalent halogen-bond potential, and the well-established D3 dispersion correction. The accuracy of the method, called Geometry, Frequency, Noncovalent, eXtended TB (GFN-xTB), is extensively benchmarked for various systems in comparison with existing semiempirical approaches, and the method is applied to a few representative structural problems in chemistry.},

	abstract = {An extended semiempirical tight-binding model is presented, which is primarily designed for the fast calculation of structures and noncovalent interaction energies for molecular systems with roughly 1000 atoms. The essential novelty in this so-called GFN2-xTB method is the inclusion of anisotropic second order density ﬂuctuation eﬀects via shortrange damped interactions of cumulative atomic multipole moments. Without noticeable increase in the computational demands, this results in a less empirical and overall more physically sound method, which does not require any classical halogen or hydrogen bonding corrections and which relies solely on global and element-speciﬁc parameters (available up to radon, Z = 86). Moreover, the atomic partial charge dependent D4 London dispersion model is incorporated self-consistently, which can be naturally obtained in a tight-binding picture from second order density ﬂuctuations. Fully analytical and numerically precise gradients (nuclear forces) are implemented. The accuracy of the method is benchmarked for a wide variety of systems and compared with other semiempirical methods. Along with excellent performance for the “target” properties, we also ﬁnd lower errors for “oﬀ-target” properties such as barrier heights and molecular dipole moments. High computational eﬃciency along with the improved physics compared to its precursor GFN-xTB makes this method well-suited to explore the conformational space of molecular systems. Signiﬁcant improvements are furthermore observed for various benchmark sets, which are prototypical for biomolecular systems in aqueous solution.},

	abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The ﬁrst assigns each processor a ﬁxed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a ﬁxed subset of inter–atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a ﬁxed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be diﬃcult to parallelize eﬃciently — those with short–range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed–memory parallel machine which allows for message–passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard–Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers — the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y–MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel eﬃciencies of 90\% and a 1840–node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C90 processor. Trade–oﬀs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is a quantum mechanical framework which describes the dynamics of interacting electronic many-body systems formally exactly and in a computationally efficient manner. This book presents the concepts of TDDFT at the graduate level. An overview is given of the current state of the art of the field, with many applications in physics, (bio)chemistry, and materials science. The book begins with a self-contained review of ground-state density-functional theory, followed by four main parts. The first part presents the formal framework of TDDFT, beginning with the basic existence theorems of Runge, Gross, and van Leeuwen. The time-dependent Kohn-Sham scheme and the properties of the time-dependent exchange-correlation potential are then discussed in detail. The second part deals with the TDDFT formulation of linear-response theory, which can be used to calculate electronic excitation energies in principle exactly using the Casida equation. An overview is given of the performance of TDDFT for atomic and molecular excitation energies, with many examples. Special attention is paid to challenging cases such as double or charge-transfer excitations. The third part of the book focuses on further developments, including time-dependent current-density-functional theory, the optimized effective potential, and the connection to many-body theory. This part also deals with excitations in extended systems, such as plasmons and excitons. Several special TDDFT topics are discussed in part four: van der Waals interactions, nanoscale transport, strong-field phenomena, and coupled electron-nuclear motion and molecular dynamics. Additional resources are provided in several appendices.},

The choice of the most accurate solution approach for a given problem depends on various vector and matrix norm relations which are discussed.

	abstract = {We present an extension to the recent 3OB parametrization of the Density Functional Tight Binding Model DFTB31,2 for biological and organic systems. Parameters for the halogens F, Cl, Br, and I have been developed for use in covalently bound systems and benchmarked on a test set of 106 molecules (the ‘OrgX’ set), using bonding distances, bonding angles, atomization energies, and vibrational frequencies to assess the performance of the parameters. Additional testing has been done with the X40 set of 40 supramolecular systems containing halogens,3 adding a simple correction for the halogen bonds that are strongly overbound in DFTB3. Furthermore, parameters for Ca, K, and Na as counterions in biological systems have been created. To benchmark geometries as well as ligand binding energies a test set ‘BioMe’ of 210 molecules has been created that cover coordination to various functional groups frequently occurring in biological systems. The new DFTB3/3OB parameter set outperforms DFT calculations with a double-ζ basis set in terms of energies and can reproduce DFT geometries, with some minor deviations in bond distances and angles due to the use of a minimal basis set.},

	abstract = {We report the parametrization of the approximate density functional theory, DFTB3, for magnesium and zinc for chemical and biological applications. The parametrization strategy follows that established in previous work that parametrized several key main group elements (O, N, C, H, P, and S). This 3OB set of parameters can thus be used to study many chemical and biochemical systems. The parameters are benchmarked using both gas-phase and condensed-phase systems. The gas-phase results are compared to DFT (mostly B3LYP), ab initio (MP2 and G3B3), and PM6, as well as to a previous DFTB parametrization (MIO). The results indicate that DFTB3/3OB is particularly successful at predicting structures, including rather complex dinuclear metalloenzyme active sites, while being semiquantitative (with a typical mean absolute deviation (MAD) of ∼3−5 kcal/mol) for energetics. Single-point calculations with high-level quantum mechanics (QM) methods generally lead to very satisfying (a typical MAD of ∼1 kcal/mol) energetic properties. DFTB3/MM simulations for solution and two enzyme systems also lead to encouraging structural and energetic properties in comparison to available experimental data. The remaining limitations of DFTB3, such as the treatment of interaction between metal ions and highly charged/polarizable ligands, are also discussed.},

	abstract = {We report the parametrization of the approximate density functional tight binding method, DFTB3, for sulfur and phosphorus. The parametrization is done in a framework consistent with our previous 3OB set established for O, N, C, and H, thus the resulting parameters can be used to describe a broad set of organic and biologically relevant molecules. The 3d orbitals are included in the parametrization, and the electronic parameters are chosen to minimize errors in the atomization energies. The parameters are tested using a fairly diverse set of molecules of biological relevance, focusing on the geometries, reaction energies, proton aﬃnities, and hydrogen bonding interactions of these molecules; vibrational frequencies are also examined, although less systematically. The results of DFTB3/ 3OB are compared to those from DFT (B3LYP and PBE), ab initio (MP2, G3B3), and several popular semiempirical methods (PM6 and PDDG), as well as predictions of DFTB3 with the older parametrization (the MIO set). In general, DFTB3/3OB is a major improvement over the previous parametrization (DFTB3/MIO), and for the majority cases tested here, it also outperforms PM6 and PDDG, especially for structural properties, vibrational frequencies, hydrogen bonding interactions, and proton aﬃnities. For reaction energies, DFTB3/3OB exhibits major improvement over DFTB3/MIO, due mainly to signiﬁcant reduction of errors in atomization energies; compared to PM6 and PDDG, DFTB3/3OB also generally performs better, although the magnitude of improvement is more modest. Compared to high-level calculations, DFTB3/3OB is most successful at predicting geometries; larger errors are found in the energies, although the results can be greatly improved by computing single point energies at a high level with DFTB3 geometries. There are several remaining issues with the DFTB3/3OB approach, most notably its diﬃculty in describing phosphate hydrolysis reactions involving a change in the coordination number of the phosphorus, for which a speciﬁc parametrization (3OB/OPhyd) is developed as a temporary solution; this suggests that the current DFTB3 methodology has limited transferability for complex phosphorus chemistry at the level of accuracy required for detailed mechanistic investigations. Therefore, fundamental improvements in the DFTB3 methodology are needed for a reliable method that describes phosphorus chemistry without ad hoc parameters. Nevertheless, DFTB3/3OB is expected to be a competitive QM method in QM/MM calculations for studying phosphorus/sulfur chemistry in condensed phase systems, especially as a low-level method that drives the sampling in a dual-level QM/MM framework.},

Being applied in combination with the parametrization of its predecessor (MIO), DFTB3 improves for hydrogen binding energies, proton aﬃnities, and hydrogen transfer barriers. In the present study, parameters especially designed for DFTB3 are presented, and its performance is evaluated for small organic molecules focusing on thermochemistry, geometries, and vibrational frequencies from our own and several databases from literature. The new parameters remove signiﬁcant overbinding errors, reduce errors for geometries of noncovalent interactions, and improve the overall performance.},
